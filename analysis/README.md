# Analyses related to the flash model


## Performance: looking at a crude 2D measures

These look at our ability to reproduce the MC in terms of
course measures of the light output. These include

* q-averaged X vs. PE sum
* q-averaged Z vs. PE sum


## Direct contrast to the light model prediction

Here we can look at slices of the detector position and compare the photon model prediction
for point energy deposits.
The photon library grid is not the same as the photon model grid.

## Measures of error for different types of events

Of particular interest are interactions near the charge threshold.
Or even data events selected from the EXTBNB or the Neutrino Open data.
Can we select events below the WireCell threshold once we have a model?

## Flash Match solution metrics

Measure how well we can solve the flash-match problem.
Would be nice to have examples that range in solving difficulty (number of tracks).
But also need a measure of solution confidence.
