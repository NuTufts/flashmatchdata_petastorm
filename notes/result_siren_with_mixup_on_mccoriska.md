# Notes on learning the MicroBooNE Light model

TODO: include plots characterizing result of first attempt at defining and training a model.

For now, these are just notes to remind myself of what we did when training on the corsika data.
This is in preparation to training on the real flash-matched EXTBNB dataset.

We used the script, `train_siren.py`, to train.

To get repository state (for the most part):

```
git checkout -b "northern-sea-231" 2c6bfd13dbc458b2dcbab97e9e9073e6cbbfda2e
```
